This sample script runs a model composed of a single, non-reactive species.
After each run, the script prints the real time it took to run the simulation
in seconds. This script may be useful for a simple benchmarking purpose.

T: time when simulation is stopped.
V: the volume of the space used in the simulation.
N: the number of particles in the simulator volume.
D: Diffusion coefficient = 1e-12 [m^2/s]
R: Radius of particles = 2.5e-9 [m]

Periodic boundary
After N particles are randomly placed, the simulator runs for some small 
duration of time (stirTime in the script) to stir. After that, the simulator is
re-initialized, and run for T to take the benchmark.

To compare the output of reactions:
python plot_reaction.py

To compare the output of diffusion:
python plot_diffusion.py
