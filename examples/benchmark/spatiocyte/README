Runtime for Michaelis-Menten reaction
-------------------------------------
The reaction model is a modified version of the benchmark Michaelis-Menten 
model provided in Supporting Information Text S1 of Andrews et al, PLoS Comp 
Biol 2010.

1. To run the reaction with ODE-based mass action:
   $ ecell3-session ode.py 

2. To run the reaction with Spatiocyte:
   $ ecell3-session reaction.py 

3. To run the reaction using small step-interval with Spatiocyte:
   $ ecell3-session reaction_small_dt.py 

4. To plot and view the results:
   $ python ../plot_reaction.py

Runtime for diffusion
---------------------
1. To run single instance of the diffusion benchmark model:
   $ python run_single.py

2. To run all instances of the diffusion benchmark model:
   $ python run_all.py

3. To run all instances of the diffusion benchmark model with low concentration
   diffusing molecules (warning, this model requires about 35 GB of memory):
   $ python run_all_dilute.py

4. To view the plot after running the models:
   $ python ../plot_diffusion.py
